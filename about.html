    <h2>Hello! I'm Faiyaz</h2>
    <p>I started playing guitar at a young age and have over 5+ years of experience performing and teaching.

My approach focuses on making learning simple, enjoyable, and tailored to each student’s pace.

I believe anyone can learn guitar with the right guidance and practice.

In my lessons, you’ll learn not just songs, but also music theory, rhythm, and techniques that make you a versatile player.

I encourage creativity and help students develop their own style, whether they want to play classical, rock, pop, or acoustic music.

My mission is to create a supportive learning environment where mistakes are part of learning, and every small progress is celebrated.

I also provide tips on practice routines, posture, finger exercises, and techniques to improve speed and accuracy.

Joining my lessons means joining a community of guitar enthusiasts who share tips, challenges, and motivation.

Learning guitar isn’t just about playing—it’s about building confidence, discipline, and a lifelong love for music.</p>
